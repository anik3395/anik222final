                        The country has a Bengali Muslim majority; while neighboring Indian Bengali-speaking regions like West Bengal, Tripura and the Barak Valley have a Bengali Hindu majority. Ancient Bengal was an important cultural center in the Indian subcontinent as the home of the states of Vanga, Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. The Mauryan, Gupta, Pala, Sena, Chandra and Deva dynasties were the last pre-Islamic rulers of Bengal.

                     <p>Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.[1] The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application</p>

                      <p> think we have a lot of opportunities to help poor people. I can work voluntarily with different organizations. I can help them with money or give them extra things like clothes and shoes. I can help them with education. We can help them to stop wars. We can give them small loans to open their own businesses.

                        My responsibility is to help poor people, because many people donâ€™t have enough food and clothes. In the world there are many problems with war, religion, and different types of criminality. So most of the poor people face these types of problems. So we should help them! If I have clothes, I could give it to them, if I have food, I could give it to them</p>
